My Reminder Privacy PolicyLast Updated: March 18, 2025

This service is provided by sihiver at no cost and is intended for use as is. This privacy policy aims to inform users about My Reminder's policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information. By using this service, you agree to the collection and use of your information in accordance with this privacy policy. If you do not agree, please stop using and uninstall My Reminder immediately.

1. Information Collection and Use

The My Reminder software itself does not send any information to the developer, but the application market where you download the software (such as Google Play) may collect relevant information about the running status of the application and provide it to the My Reminder developer. For this information, please read the privacy policy provided by the marketplace you use.

When you report errors in the software operation to the My Reminder developers, the developers may ask you to provide software and system logs to help confirm the cause of the problem. Since the logs may contain sensitive information, such information should only be sent by yourself. We do not make any express or implied guarantee for the security and privacy of any transmission service. Please choose a method that is acceptable to you when transmitting relevant information.
